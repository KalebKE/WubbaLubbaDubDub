# WubbaLubbaDubDub – The Ultimate Rick and Morty Multiverse Explorer!  

**Hey Morty, get over here! We got an app, Morty! An app that lets you dive into the infinite insanity of the Rick and Morty multiverse!**  
It’s called **WubbaLubbaDubDub**, and it’s like having an interdimensional portal gun—but, you know, for *browsing characters* instead of making bad life choices.

## 🛸 Search the Multiverse in Real Time!  
- Type a name, and BOOM! The app swaps out the word **“Rick”** with your search term and instantly updates results.  
- *Yeah, yeah, we get it—your fingers are too fast for the internet.* Don’t worry, results update **after every keystroke** without skipping a beat.  
- No more existential dread waiting for results—there’s a **progress indicator** that lets you know something’s happening, but without freezing the whole app like some glitchy Meeseeks.

## 🧬 Character Profiles—Because Knowledge is (Interdimensional) Power!  
Tap a character and get hit with a **full-blown detail view**, packed with everything your squishy Earth brain needs:  

✔ **Name** – Big, bold, and in-your-face like Rick after three Flurbos of Schnapps.  
✔ **Full-width Image** – *BEHOLD* their glory in all its pixelated magnificence.  
✔ **Species** – Because you gotta know if you’re dealing with a Gromflomite, a Squanchy, or just another basic human.  
✔ **Status** – Alive? Dead? *Schrödinger’s Beth?* You’ll find out.  
✔ **Origin** – Know where they came from before they got caught up in some wacky sci-fi nonsense.  
✔ **Type (if applicable)** – Some characters are more than meets the eye—like how Mr. Poopybutthole is *not* a parasite (we think?).  
✔ **Formatted Creation Date** – Because *who doesn’t* want to know when an API thought this character should exist?

Look, if you don’t download **WubbaLubbaDubDub**, I don’t know what to tell you—maybe you belong in the **Jerryboree** daycare.  
But if you *do* get it? Well, you might just earn yourself a *tiny, fleeting* moment of happiness before the crushing weight of reality sets in.  

🔬 **DOWNLOAD NOW!** (Or don’t. Time is meaningless, Morty!)
